* Brief
=======
 - Here is the tarball composition:
        mafi-notes-lehuen
          |-- mafi-notes-lehuen-exercices.ods
          |-- mafi-notes-lehuen.pdf
          `-- README

 - The .pdf file contains all the material I typed during the MAFI (Bases Mathématiques pour les Métiers de la Finance) course.
 - The .ods file contains the solution of two exercices : 5.1. and 5.2. in the .pdf file.



* Usage
=======
 - Reading the pdf file again and again until the exam starts might be pretty helpful.
 - Redoing the exercices might help too.
 - You can send the tarball to anyone who could need it.
